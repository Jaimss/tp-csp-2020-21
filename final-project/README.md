# Final Project
Creating a Custom Encoder (2.3.1)

### To Run the Program
In the root project directory execute
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
  - Note: `pip3 -V` is `20.0.2`
  - Note: `python3 -V` is `Python 3.8.5`
Again in the root project directory execute
- `python3 main.py`
Additional Requirements:
- `python3-tk`

### Goals
- Apply all you have learned to create or modify a custom encoding tool (not a traditional encryption algorithm) to encode a message.
- Explain how a code segment or program functions.
- Identify data storage and usage in your program.
- Explain how an abstraction manages complexity in your program.
- Describe a procedure call in your program.

### Materials
- Screen capturing (screenshot) software

#### Problems
- 1 & 2
    - Run encode & decode to get a gif file. When you decode it the message is `changeme` as well as a lot of binary.
